# Hi there, I'm Tushar! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Georgia, passionate about Artificial Intelligence and building impactful software solutions. My journey in tech has led me to explore full-stack development, cloud infrastructure, and the exciting world of machine learning.

## About Me

* **Currently**: A Software Engineer Intern at CRST The Transportation Solution, Inc. [cite: 6]
* **Education**: Pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with an emphasis on AI from the University of Georgia, graduating in August 2025. [cite: 1]
* **Interests**: I love diving deep into AI-powered predictive models[cite: 11], optimizing system performance[cite: 6, 12, 14], and architecting scalable cloud solutions[cite: 7, 8, 13, 17, 20].
* **What I'm building**: Always working on exciting projects! Recently, I've been focused on an AI-powered email management platform (InboxIQ) [cite: 18] and a Chrome extension for job seekers using OpenAI GPT (CareerSync)[cite: 22].

## My Toolkit

* **Languages**: C++, Java, Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, SQL, Bash [cite: 2]
* **Frameworks & Libraries**: React.js, Next.js, Node.js, Spring Boot [cite: 2]
* **Databases**: PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Cassandra [cite: 2]
* **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS (Lambda, RDS, S3), Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, Azure [cite: 2]
* **Tools & Methodologies**: Git, CI/CD (GitHub Actions, Jenkins), Agile, Unit Testing, Integration Testing [cite: 3]
* **Monitoring**: Elasticsearch, Kibana, Prometheus [cite: 3]

## Experience Highlights

* Engineered and fine-tuned Java Spring Boot microservices, improving API response time by 30%[cite: 6].
* Built AI-powered predictive models using Transformers and Graph Neural Networks (GNNs), increasing model accuracy by 15%[cite: 11].
* Implemented ML models on AWS Lambda for scalable AI-based fact-checking[cite: 13].
* Architected a centralized logging system using Kibana and Elasticsearch[cite: 8].
* Provided Tier 1 IT support to 1,000+ faculty, staff, and students, achieving 80% first contact resolution rate[cite: 15].
