# Hey there!  I'm Tushar

CS student (closing in on graduation) at UGA who's obsessed with making computers do cool stuff (especially the AI kind). When I'm not debugging at 2 AM or trying to come up with random, stupid ideas, I am probably thinking about how AI is taking over the world 

## What I'm up to these days

Right now, I'm on the hunt for Software Engineer opportunities where I can actually put my skills to good use instead of just talking about them in interviews 😅

I'm wrapping up my Computer Science degree at the University of Georgia this August (2025) - majoring in the "let's teach machines to think or can they?" specialty, aka AI emphasis. 

## The stuff that gets me excited

I'm that person who genuinely finds joy in:
- Building AI models that actually work (pretty revolutionary, right? I know)
- Making slow systems fast and fast systems faster
- Wrestling with cloud infrastructure until it behaves
- Creating full-stack applications that don't fall apart when someone clicks a button

## Let's build something awesome together
