# Hey there!  I'm Tushar

CS student (closing in on graduation) at UGA who's obsessed with making computers do cool stuff (especially the AI kind). When I'm not debugging at 2 AM or trying to come up with random, stupid ideas, I am probably thinking about how AI is taking over the world 

## What I'm up to these days

Right now I'm on the hunt for Software Engineer opportunities where I can actually put my skills to good use instead of just talking about them in interviews üòÖ

I'm wrapping up my Computer Science degree at the University of Georgia this August (2025) - majoring in the "let's teach machines to think or can they?" specialty, aka AI emphasis. 

## The stuff that gets me excited

I'm that person who genuinely finds joy in:
- Building AI models that actually work (pretty revolutionary,right? I know)
- Making slow systems fast and fast systems faster
- Wrestling with cloud infrastructure until it behaves
- Creating full-stack applications that don't fall apart when someone clicks a button

## Current side quest: Deal Radar 

I'm working on this pretty neat project called Deal Radar, basically teaching a program to be better at finding deals than your aunt who somehow always knows about every sale. It crawls through Amazon, Walmart, and other sites to hunt down the best deals so you don't have to refresh 47 browser tabs. Also, a secret project ( not of national importance)  that I would love to talk about, but only on LinkedIn or Discord, I would really appreciate feedback on it
